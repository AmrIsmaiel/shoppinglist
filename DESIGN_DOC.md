# Shopping List Module Design Document

## Architecture Overview

This Shopping List module follows MVVM + Clean Architecture principles to create a modular, testable, and maintainable feature that can be easily integrated into a super-app. The architecture is structured in the following layers:

1. **UI Layer (Presentation)**: Jetpack Compose UI components and ViewModels that handle UI state
2. **Domain Layer**: Business logic and use cases independent of any Android framework
3. **Data Layer**: Repository implementation and data sources (local and remote)

## Key Design Decisions

### Offline-First Strategy

The module implements a robust offline-first approach where:

- All user actions are immediately persisted to local storage
- Operations are queued for synchronization when offline
- Conflicts are resolved using a last-write-wins timestamp strategy
- WorkManager with exponential backoff handles background synchronization

This ensures the app remains fully functional without internet connectivity while maintaining data integrity when connectivity is restored.

### Technology Choices

- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern declarative UI toolkit that simplifies UI development and testing
- **Room Database**: Provides robust local persistence with SQL support and type safety
- **Hilt**: Google's recommended dependency injection solution that integrates seamlessly with other Jetpack components
- **WorkManager**: Handles background tasks with guaranteed execution and battery-friendly scheduling
- **Kotlin Coroutines + Flow**: Simplifies asynchronous operations with reactive streams

### Modularization Strategy

The feature is completely self-contained in a Gradle module that:

- Exposes a single entry point via `ShoppingListBuilder`
- Encapsulates all implementation details
- Has clear module boundaries to prevent unwanted dependencies
- Can be added to any app with minimal integration effort

## Rejected Alternatives

### Alternative 1: MVI Architecture

**Why Considered**: MVI (Model-View-Intent) would provide a unidirectional data flow with immutable states and well-defined user intents.

**Why Rejected**: While MVI offers strong consistency, it introduces additional complexity and boilerplate code that wasn't justified for this specific feature. MVVM with StateFlow provides most of the benefits (unidirectional data flow, reactive UI updates) with less overhead.

### Alternative 2: Realm Database

**Why Considered**: Realm offers real-time synchronization capabilities and a more object-oriented approach to data persistence.

**Why Rejected**: Room was chosen over Realm because:
1. Better integration with other Jetpack components
2. Simpler learning curve for developers familiar with SQL
3. Room's transaction support and migration system is more mature
4. Realm's synchronization would be redundant since we're implementing our own sync strategy

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts the data sources and provides a clean API for the domain layer
2. **Use Case Pattern**: Encapsulates business logic in single-responsibility classes
3. **Observer Pattern**: Via Flow for reactive data streams
4. **Factory Pattern**: For creating domain objects and database entities
5. **Adapter Pattern**: For mapping between different data models across layers
